			<p>My name is Kaitlyn Adams, and I was born and raised in Houston, TX. I moved to Austin to attend St. Edward's University. There, I majored in Graphic Design, graduating Summa Cum Laude in 2014. During my time on the Hilltop, I played ultimate frisbee for the school. Our team was Congressmen Ultimate, a nod to the state capitol just down the street. It's traditional for everyone on a team to garner a nickname at some point; I was deemed Showtime.</p>

			<p>When I'm not playing ultimate, I enjoy yoga and reading. I also spend a lot of time with my dog Atticus. It was a lifelong dream of mine to own a bull terrier, and now I do. I like to call him an aggressive lover. Bull terriers are known for looking tough, but he is actually the biggest cuddler on planet earth.</p>
